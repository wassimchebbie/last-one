Readiness for the Next Step
As I approach the next step in my career as a software developer, I feel confident and prepared to take on new challenges. Throughout this bootcamp, I have gained valuable skills in full-stack development, particularly in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). Additionally, I have developed hands-on experience working on various projects, such as:
